# My First Xeneta

## Usage

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Single build
$ npm run build
# Watcher build (Rebuilds on file changes)
$ npm run watch
# Start development server
$ npm start
```

# Specifications
The project will build HTML using EJS templates from the `views` folder. JavaScript is built from the `src/index.js`
entrypoint. JavaScript is set up to be built using Webpack 4 and Babel 6. The necessary plugins and options for
building with JSX are also set up.

If you prefer using another framework than React, ensure that you provide and configure the appropriate loaders and
plugins if needed.

# Evaluation
When evaluating the code, we will install dependencies, run a single build, then start the development server.
